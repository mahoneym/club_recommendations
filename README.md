# club_recommendations

  This repository is my senior project for Computer Science. I am developing it on a Mac operating system, and the commands included will be for the Mac terminal. This repository is a club recommendation system, which will help students to find clubs based on the clubs in which the user is already participating. To do this, I am using a weighted graph system. The users have pointers to each of the their clubs, and these connections are not weighted. On the other hand, the clubs also have connections between them. The weight of these connections is the number of common members between the two clubs. If two clubs have zero members in common, there will not be an edge between the two nodes.
  When making a recommendation, the system will go to one of the user's clubs (based on a random number generator). Then, the program will look for the heaviest connection between clubs which leaves the chosen club. If the user is already in this connection, the recommender will not return this club and will look for another one.
  To build it, I am using Python3. In order to run the test program, which was built during development to make sure the system is working as expected, I navigate to the project's directory and use 'python3 tester.py' in the terminal. This will  run tests that I have written for the recommender and will print some results after the file runs. 
  A graphical user interface [GUI] is also available for this recommendation system. Similar to the test program, I navigate to the project's directory and use 'python3 interface.py' in the terminal. Another window should come up, where an entry box will come up. At this point, users with ID's 1-5 should have club recommendations, any other user ID will cause a pop up error message.
